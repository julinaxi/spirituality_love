      <h3><i>What Does Spirituality Mean?</i></h3>
      <p>Spirituality involves the recognition of a feeling or sense or belief that there is something greater than yourself, something more to being human than sensory experience, and that the greater whole of which we are part is cosmic or divine in nature.</p>
      <p>Spirituality means knowing that our lives have significance in a context beyond a
        mundane everyday existence at the level of biological needs that drive selfishness
        and aggression. It means knowing that we are a significant part of a purposeful
        unfolding of Life in our universe.</p>

      <h4><i>What does The Chakras mean? </i></h4>
      <p>The word "Chakra" translates to wheel in Sanskrit. It refers to wheels of energy throughout the body. There
        are seven main chakras, which align the spine, starting from the base of the spine through to the crown of
        the head. If any of the Chakras are blocked, then energy cannot flow freely, causing emotional and
        physical ailments. Each of the chakras is directly related to a part of our body and affect your overall
        health. It is vital to clear and open these wheels to allow out body to function as it was designed.</p>
      <h3><i>What is an Aura?</i></h3>
      <p>Auras are thought of as the unseen field of energy surrounding a person's physical body. They're affected by our mood and emotional state (and sometimes the states of others), and different colors are associated with different qualities and emotions. Someone's aura is usually a combination of colors, with one being more dominant than the others.</p>
